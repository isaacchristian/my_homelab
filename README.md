# my_homelab | Wedding Website 💍🍾

## WIP

I have a Tiny Mini Micro server that I'm gaining more experience in, using proxmox as the hypervisor. 

### Packer 💙

With Packer, I'm building a CentOS image with the essentials installed through my `ks.cfg`. 

### Terraform 💜

I'm provisioning a VM to be used as an Nginx server, hosting my wedding website. I'll be configuring Terraform Agents to do the dirty work, since it'll be hosted on-prem and not in the cloud.
